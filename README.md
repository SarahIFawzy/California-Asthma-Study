# California-Asthma-Study

Welcome to our submission for the third project of the UC Berkeley Data Analytics bootcamp. This project was completed as part of the curriculum to showcase our  cumulative knowledge of the past week's assignments, including our proficiency in basic JavaScript Mapping using libraries such as D3 and Leaflet plugins, linear charts, and building interactive sites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Project Description 
For project 3, we were tasked with developing interactive visualizations and using datasets that we located via google search. We were tasked with creating either a visualization track, or a data engineering track. Our group chose to develop a project using data visualization route. We chose to research environmental factors in California that may be contributing to asthma causes and/or symptoms. 
In order to do so, we found 3 datasets via data.ca.gov While we would have liked to include more datasets, we were not able to find viable data (such as tobacco usage, or wildfire data) within the time constraints. 
After locating the datasets, and cleaning them, we created a flask application so our html document would read the datasets. Lastly, using Javascript we created 3 visualizations: A JS Map, a linear chart, and a word cloud, to demonstrate the prevalence and concentration of environmental factors that could be contributing to asthma symptoms.

# To Run The Application
In order to test the application, you will want to run the files in this order:
1) In your terminal, activate your dev environment, and run db.py
2) next, run the flask application by running app.py
3) lastly plug the url  provided (http://127.0.0.1:5000/) into your web browser.

# Resources Used
- The datasets were provided by data.ca.gov
- Learning materials were provided by the UC Berkeley Data Analytics Bootcamp, from modules 1 - 16. 
-For any additional syntax or materials that we were not familiar with, we used resources such as the Xpert Learning Assistant, provided by UC Berkeley Bootcamp, Flask, Leaflet, and D3 Documentation, and ChatGPT.
